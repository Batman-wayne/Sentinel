# Sentinel
The official repository for Project Sentinel, our entry into the 2019-2020 TiM$10K Challenge, hosted by SICK INC. Project Sentinel is a LIDAR-based, autonomous security robot that is intended to become a new member of the security team of the location of interest (examples include indoor home or business security). Sentinel would roam the building room by room, using SICK's TiM781 LIDAR sensor to quickly and accurately scan its surroundings, including areas that are normally hard to reach such as behind desks and under beds. 

Upon detection of an intruder, Sentinel would silent pursue the intruder, while alerting the owners to the intruder's current position and transmitting its location.
